#### **About**

The existing systems in the Human Resource and Management Office (HRMO) consist of disparate databases and applications separate from the University Integrated Information Systems (UIIS) that the Management Information Systems (MIS) office manages. Since systems deployed by the MIS office include employee records, having separate databases from HRMO leads to data duplication, inaccuracy, and inconsistency. Migrating to a centralized Human Resource Information System (HRIS) ensures all employee data are stored in the UIIS database, facilitating easier access, management, and reporting. The new HRIS is designed to streamline HRMO processes, standardize workflows, and improve data integrity.

Additionally, as the university grows and evolves, the existing HRMO systems may struggle to accommodate increasing volumes of data or integrate with other systems. Migrating to a scalable HRIS offers the agility to meet evolving requirements, support future institutional growth, and enable seamless integration with other systems currently deployed or under development by the MIS office.

**The primary objectives of this project are as follows:**

-   Migrate all employee data from disparate sources / existing systems into a centralized repository within the new HRIS, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and accessibility.
-   Evaluate existing HRMO systems and processesâ€“ to identify areas for improvement and redesign workflow within the new HRIS to improve efficiency.
-   Integrate seamlessly with other systems, ensuring scalability, interoperability, and alignment with the Universityâ€™s needs.
-   Develop a comprehensive migration plan and communication strategy to minimize disruption to HR operations and ensure a smooth transition to the new HRIS without compromising productivity or service delivery of the unit.
