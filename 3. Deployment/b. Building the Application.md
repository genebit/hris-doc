# b. Building the Application ❗️

To build the application, we create a `build` directory under `public` for the website's Vite compiled assets.

```bash
# Compiles and bundles the application for production.
npm run build
```

### Extra options

```bash
# Clears compiled files, cached assets, and resets build artifacts.
npm run clear
# Rebuilds or manages cached dependencies and assets.
npm run cache
# Optimizes the framework, routes, and configuration for better performance.
npm run optimize
```
