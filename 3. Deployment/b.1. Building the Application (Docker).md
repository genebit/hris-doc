# b.1. Building the Application (Docker)

To build the application in docker, we first require to have the docker engine be running. We run the following command after:

```bash
docker build -t hris:latest .
```

### Pull image from Docker Hub

```bash
docker pull genebit/hris:latest
```

### Run the Application

docker compose up -d
```
